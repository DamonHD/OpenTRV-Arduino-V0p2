Things to check before each board goes to manufacturing:

* Suitable board finish (ENIG if using TMP112 sensor: speced when ordering, not in Eagle).
* Standard board thickness of 1.6mm.
* All components listed in BOM.
* Board dimensions and mounting hole locations must match 'DD1' 5x5 standard.
* All Gerber layers generated, eg including milling (TIP: just zip everything and fab house will have what they need)>>>>>>> .r2042

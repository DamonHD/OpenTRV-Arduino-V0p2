A few points to note for PCB assembly.

 1) Mode button is on flying leads (~60mm)
    and needs to be fitted through lid (from front) before soldering up.

 2) Top of LED should be 15mm above board so as to
    sit just behind 5mm hole in front panel.

 3) LDR should be bent 90 degrees to face out to left of board 
    with as good illumination from external ambient light as possible
    via slot looking out just below screw terminals
    as near to level with (just above) the PCB as is practicable.

 4) DO NOT mount TMP112 on non-SMD (top) side of board with fat pads,
    please mount on normal pads on SMD (reverse) side.

 5) Antenna wire should run straight, vertically out of box,
    supporting its own weight.

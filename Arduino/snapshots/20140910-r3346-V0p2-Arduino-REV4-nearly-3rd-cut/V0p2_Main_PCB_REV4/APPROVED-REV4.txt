This is a list of DRC "errors" that should be approved for REV2 as "by design".
Examples include supply lines to components with small pad footprints,
and links between distinct supply nets to allow star for wiring, etc.


BH20130710: Track width error at SHT21; just make sure its as wide as the pad its coming from.
BH20130710: Drill size on via under SHT21. Not critical. the error is there as i have set DRC to spec via's at minimum 0.5, but that is to big here, the hole serves as a mean to hand solder the pad under SHT21, but also serves as normal via
BH20130710: Clearance issues on USB.; its just the gnd track going from once shield pin to the other.

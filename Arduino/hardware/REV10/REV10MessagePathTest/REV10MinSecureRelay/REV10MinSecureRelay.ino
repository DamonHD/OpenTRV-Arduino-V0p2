  Test of minimum relay code path.

  DHD20130417: hardware setup on bare board.
    * 1MHz CPU clock (from 8MHz internal RC clock with /8 prescaler) ATmega328P running at 1.8V--5V (typically 2V--3.3V).
    * Fuse set for BOD-managed additional clock settle time, ie as fast a restart from sleep as possible.
    * All unused pins unconnected and nominally floating (though driven low as output where possible).
    * 32768Hz xtal between pins XTAL1 and XTAL2, async timer 2, for accurate timekeeping and low-power sleep.
    * All unused system modules turned off.

  Basic AVR power consumption ticking an (empty) control loop at ~0.5Hz should be ~1uA.

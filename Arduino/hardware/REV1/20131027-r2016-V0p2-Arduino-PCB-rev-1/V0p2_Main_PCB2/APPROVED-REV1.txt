This is a list of DRC "errors" that should be approved for this revision as "by design".
Examples include supply lines to components with small pad footprints,
and links between distinct supply nets to allow star for wiring, etc.

BH20130710: Approved overlap DRC on sh1 part, this part replaces SJ1 and the only way it can be done easily is by overlapping 2 pads.

BH20130710: track width error at TMP112. Just made sure its as wide as the pad its comming from

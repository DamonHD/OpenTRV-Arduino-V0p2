20170112: Capacitor C11 in series with nRESET line
Problem Description:
Capacitor C11 is in series with the ICSP nRESET line. This prevents the board
from being programmed over ICSP with, for example, a bootloader.
Fix:
1) The board can be programmed by using a pair of tweezers to short across C11.
2) Alternatively, C11 can be replaced with a jumper (e.g. pads shorted with a
solder blob). Note that this means that an external ~100 nF capacitor will be
required in series with the RTS line when programming with a serial adaptor.

Acceptance tests after moving hub/relay (REV2/REV9) comms to new channel 2016/01:

 1) The REV9 must still control the FHT8V, including initial sync, as commanded by the REV2 remotely.
 2) The protocol between REV2 and REV9 must be working as before (on the new channel).
 3) The new and old channels do not interfere.

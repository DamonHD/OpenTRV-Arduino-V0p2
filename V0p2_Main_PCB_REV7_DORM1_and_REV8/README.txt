REV7/REV8 is the set of production-engineering schematics being prepared by Select Oct 2014 onwards.

The code reserves REV7 and REV8 for this version for software configuration purposes.

REV7 is the all-in-one TRV also known as DORM1 as it was originally conceived for university dormitories.

REV8 is the boiler unit, possibly configured not to drive a local valve and possibly not receive stats,
but in any case containing the boiler relay and not containing the REV7 motor H-bridge.

This is a list of DRC "errors" that should be approved for REV2 as "by design".
Examples include supply lines to components with small pad footprints,
and links between distinct supply nets to allow star for wiring, etc.


BH20130710: Track width error at SHT21; just make sure its as wide as the pad its coming from.
BH20130710: Clearance issues on USB.; its just the gnd track going from once shield pin to the other.

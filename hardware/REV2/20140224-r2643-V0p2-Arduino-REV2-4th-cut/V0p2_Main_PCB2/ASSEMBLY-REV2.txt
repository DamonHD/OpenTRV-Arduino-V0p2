A few points to note for PCB assembly.


 1A)**IF YOU ARE ASSEMBLING WITH ENCLOSURE** Mode button is on flying
    leads (~60mm) and needs to be fitted through lid (from front)
    before soldering up to the BRB1 and BRB2 connections.

 1B)**IF YOU ARE ___NOT___ ASSEMBLING WITH ENCLOSURE** Please solder
    60mm flying leads to board and strip and tin 4mm of free end of
    wires for both BRB1 and BRB2 connections. Please procure and
    supply Mode buttons and ship them loose to us with the boards.

 2) Top of LED should be 15mm (fifteen) above top surface of board
    so as to sit just behind hole in front panel.

 3) LDR should be bent 90 degrees to face out to left of board 
    with as good illumination from external ambient light as possible
    via slot looking out just below screw terminals
    as near to level with (just above) the PCB as is practicable.

 4) DO NOT mount TMP2 (TMP112) on non-SMD (top) side of board with
    enlarged pads, please mount TMP1 (TMP112) on normal pads on SMD
    (reverse) side.

 5) Antenna wire should run straight, vertically out of box (if
    being enclosed), supporting its own weight (the wire is specified
    as single core in order to be self supporting).

 6) AVRs, once bootloaded and programmed, will conduct a Power On
    Self Test when power is applied to the board. The flashes of the
    LED will be in sequence: 1 flash, 2 flashes, 3 flashes, 4 flashes,
    5 flashes. At this point the LED will no longer flash obviously.
    Managing to reach 5 flashes in the sequence means that the POST
    succeeded and should be classed as a functional board. Bootloader
    and program will be supplied.

 7) For pot leg support holes milling can be replaced by slot drilling;
    leg is 2mm wide and mfr's diagram shows 2.1mm x 1.8mm slot.

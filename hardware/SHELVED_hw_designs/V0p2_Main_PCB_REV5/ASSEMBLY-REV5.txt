A few points to note for PCB assembly.


 1) Please make sure Rot. encoder is as precise centered as posible

 2) Top of LDR/Photo transistor should be 15mm (fifteen) above top surface of board
    so as to sit just behind hole in front panel

 4) Antenna wire should run straight, vertically out of box (if
    being enclosed), supporting its own weight (the wire is specified
    as single core in order to be self supporting).

 5) AVRs, once bootloaded and programmed, will conduct a Power On
    Self Test when power is applied to the board. The flashes of the
    LED will be in sequence: 1 flash, 2 flashes, 3 flashes, 4 flashes,
    5 flashes. At this point the LED will no longer flash obviously.
    Managing to reach 5 flashes in the sequence means that the POST
    succeeded and should be classed as a functional board. Bootloader
    and program will be supplied.

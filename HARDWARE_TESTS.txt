Hardware and Tests
==================
DHD20170112
DE20170112

Schematics and PCB designs for AVR/ATMega board XXX are generally under:

    Arduino/hardware/XXX
    
Within each board area should be a subdirectory XXXHardwareTest, for the
basic hardware tests for the board. The folder should contain the following:
- XXXHardwareTest.ino
    - An Arduino source file. 
    - This can be compiled and loaded using the Arduino IDE and a FTDI cable.
- XXXHardwareTest.ino.hex
    - A binary of the test, precompiled for ATMega328P.
    - This can be loaded using avrdude and an ISP programmer.
- XXXHardwareTest.ino.with_bootloader.hex
    - A binary of the test, precompiled for ATMega328P.
    - This can be loaded using avrdude and an ISP programmer.

NOTE! need to specify which binary to use and when!

The test routines should exercise all peripherals on present on the board,
printing an output to serial where appropriate. This includes:
- Readings from all on board sensors.
- Radio Rx data on boards typically used as recievers or hubs.
- Verifying the onboard realtime clock source runs.
- Flashing LEDs where present.

The test will not do anything that might be unfriendly, such as transmitting,
since the band (etc) used may not be legal everywhere.

The .ino file will often also be used in CI (continuous integration)
at least to check for the ability to compile.

Hardware and Tests
==================
DHD20170112

Schematics and PCB designs for AVR/ATMega board XXX are generally under:

    Arduino/hardware/XXX
    
Within each board area should be a subdirectory XXXHardwareTest
containing a XXXHardwareTest.ino source file to safely test an XXX board.

Also present should be output .hex files (with and without bootloader),
to enable testing of hardware with only avrdude or equivalent to hand,
ie without having to set up an entire development environment.

The test routines should (eg) show useful stuff on the serial connection,
including sensor readings to show that any sensors are working.

The test may also listen on the radio if that board is typically used
as a receiver/hub.

The test will not do anything that might be unfriendly, such as transmitting,
since the band (etc) used may not be legal everywhere.

The .ino file will often also be used in CI (continuous integration)
at least to check for the ability to compile.

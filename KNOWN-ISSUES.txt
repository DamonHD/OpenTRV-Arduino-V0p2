Summary: valve can hover, still closed, calling for heat
Product: Sunamp / Energy Solutions (TRV1 / TRV1.5) trials
Branch: TRV1.5-rc3
Tag: 20161211-RC3b
Repo(s): OpenTRV-Arduino-V0p2 (+ OTRadioLink, OTAESGCM)
Hardware: REV10 (boiler controller)
Date reported: 2016/09/21
Bug tracker URL: https://opentrv.atlassian.net/browse/TODO-1096
Fixed at tag / branch / date : 20170102-reduced-valve-movement / master / 20170102
Description:
In a very still room with stable temperatures,
depending on the physical valve base in use,
for TRV1.5 to continue to call for heat indefinitely
but without the valve actually allowing water to pass
so the room temperature does not rise to stop the call for heat.
Workaround:
A valve head shim may help.


Summary: combined boiler hub / stats relay / boiler control does not send own stats over GSM
Product: Sunamp / Energy Solutions (TRV1 / TRV1.5) trials
Branch: TRV1.5-rc1
Tag: TRV1.5-rv1-gE-20160919
Repo(s): OpenTRV-Arduino-V0p2 (+ OTRadioLink, OTAESGCM)
Hardware: REV10 (boiler controller)
Date reported: 2016/09/21
Bug tracker URL: https://opentrv.atlassian.net/browse/TODO-978
Fixed at tag / date:
Description:
REV10 relays stats correctly from REV7s, but does not relay its own,
preventing direct remote tracking of when boiler is being run.
May also be failing to send its stats over local ISM radio,
preventing tracking by local separate stats hub.
Workaround:

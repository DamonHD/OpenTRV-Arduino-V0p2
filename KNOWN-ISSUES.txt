Summary: combined boiler hub / stats relay / boiler control does not send own stats over GSM
Product: Sunamp / Energy Solutions (TRV1 / TRV1.5) trials
Branch: TRV1.5-rc1
Tag: TRV1.5-rv1-gE-20160919
Repo(s): OpenTRV-Arduino-V0p2
Hardware: REV10 (boiler controller)
Date reported: 2016/09/21
Bug tracker URL: https://opentrv.atlassian.net/browse/TODO-978
Description:
REV10 relays stats correctly from REV7s, but does not relay its own,
preventing direct remote tracking of when boiler is being run.
May also be failing to send its stats over local ISM radio,
preventing tracking by local separate stats hub.

REV5 SHT21 temp+RH sensor + various adjustments R&D board:
    replaced TMP with SHT21
    replaced (a) LED (b) Mode button (c) pot  meter with rot. encoder
    replaced AVR with SMD version but same chip
    removed the extra resistor on the phototransistor as i thought it was only there for experiments and not a final product
    
    planned to exchange the screw terminals for a plugable terminal like this one: http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/pcb-terminal-blocks/7075348/ less need to open box

How to set a house code on a REV9 unit to match the FHT8V valve’s
==================================================================

When the ‘>’ CLI prompt shows you have a short time (<<2s) to enter a command.
(You can wake the CLI with a few newlines; it will go to sleep again after a couple of minutes.)

At the prompt enter:

    H nn mm

terminated with newline (\n) to set the housecode to match the C1 and C2 values of the FHT8V,
eg if the valve showed C1 70 C2 03 then enter:

    H 70 03

or even just:

    H 70 3

so your terminal session would look like:

>H 70  3
=F1%@23CF;X0;T13 38 W255 0 F255 0 W255 0 F255 0;S 7 18;HC70 3 s
FHT8V SYNC...

(the = status line may have some different values on it)

and you should see the REV9 unit attempt to start sync with the valve immediately.

(The house code can be cleared with just a ‘H’ on its own should you want to do that.)

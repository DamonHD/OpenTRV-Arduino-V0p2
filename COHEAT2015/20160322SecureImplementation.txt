Notes on Secure Implementation Demonstration
============================================
DHD20160322

 1) The March 2016 release is intended to demonstrate securing the key interactions
    between the main components bin the COHEAT system.

 2) The interaction between the REV9 and FHT8V remains in cleartext;
    in a production system the REV9 or an OpenTRV REV7 could, for example,
    control the radiator valve directly, thus eliminating this unprotected link
    (and a source of unreliability).

 3) Some details of the security scheme have been trimmed to keep the demo code
    of manageable size, but should be implemented on a production system.
    These are noted below.

 4) Again, in a production system, where security is especially important,
    such as at secure (military, police, etc) sites, and where side channels
    may indicate a lack of personnel out on duty for example,
    or where there are particularly vulnerable people present,
    the mechanisms described to defeat traffic analysis may warrant stepping up.
 
 6) Note that the security mechanisms shown in the security demo
    are NOT intended to defeat determined state-level actors,
    nor to resist TEMPEST style attacks (or defend against physical access to devices,
    nor to resist DoS (Denial of Service) attacks on the radio channel for example.

 7) The logical interaction between a REV2 hub and its REV9 relay remains the same:
     a) the same CLI/serial input/output at either end
     b) the FHT8V valve ID being use to identify the relaying REV9 also
     c) the same GFSK fast channel being used between REV2 and REV9

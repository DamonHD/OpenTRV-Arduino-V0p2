Snapshot of OpenTRV and OTRadioLink and OTProtocolCC (re)tagged with:

    20160131-COHEAT-dual-channel-beta

New feature:

  * REV2<->REV9 channel uses new 57600bps GFSK channel; 5kbps OOK channel used only for FS20/FHT8V.


I have tested the current COHEAT functionality:

  * FHT8V control by REV9
  * alert/poll/response radio traffic
  * UI button & LEDS on REV9

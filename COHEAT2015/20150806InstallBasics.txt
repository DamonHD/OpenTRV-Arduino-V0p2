Installation Basics


Setting up the REV9/relay and FHT8V.

1) Put batteries in the FHT8V and note the house code that comes up after C1 and C2,
   eg for a display of C1 12 C2 34 then the house code is 12 34.

2) Fit the FHT8V to the rad once the motor has stopped whirring and A2 is shown if not already fitted.

3) Boot the REV9 on the CLI.  Hit send/return periodically to keep the CLI awake.

4) Press the FHT8V button and wait for the 0 to come up.

5) Enter the housecode immediately after the '>' CLI prompt comes up as H 12 34 for the above example.
   Entering the house codes like this should force the REV9 relay to restart the sync process.

6) The REV9 should show it starting to sync with the FHT8V and then about 2 minutes later show FHT SYNC FINAL.
   If the bleeper has not been disabled on the FHT8V then each of these should produce a bleep,
   confirming that everything is working.

7) The status messages (starting with =) on the REV9 should now show the valve position at 1%,
   and after about 2 minutes and an "FHT8V TX" the FHT8V should whirr a little and move to 1%.

8) If nothing is heard from the hub by the REV9 relay for a while
   (usually 30 minutes, less during initialisation)
   then the REV9 will show complaints about not hearing from the hub and moving to a safe valve position,
   the status messages should show 33%, and the FHT8V should move to 33% and show that on its display.

9) If the FHT8V stops hearing from the REV9 for an extended period it will move to (and show) 30%
   and shut down (not listen for any more radio comms) and need power cycling in conjunction with
   the REV9 to resync.

So note: the REV9 and FHT8V share the housecode ID.


REV2 hub to REV9 relay comms

1) At a REV2 send from the CLI a poll/command starting +CC1 ? eg:

    +CC1 ? 12 34 5 2 2 2

   to send to the REV9 (and thus FHT8V) with house code 12 34 in this case.
   This command also sets the valve position to 5%,
   and sets the LEDs to do green double-flashes for 60 seconds.

   See 20150803HubInteraction.txt for more details of the commands.

   You should also see a response from the REV9 with house code 12 34 such as:

    +CC1 * 12 34 25 0 98 62 1 1 1

   A REV9 relay will only respond to ? messages with its own house code in.

   See 20150803HubInteraction.txt for more details of the values.


REV9 relay to REV2 hub comms

   1) Pressing a button on the REV9 should cause an alert to be sent to all listening REV2 hubs,
      seen as (from REV9 with housecode 12 34):

    +CC1 ! 12 34

   2) That should be sent randomly about once every 2 minutes by the REV9 relay
      until the REV9 relay sees and responds to a poll from a REV2 hub.

Note: the initial (cut1) REV9 boards had the switch stuck in the on position.

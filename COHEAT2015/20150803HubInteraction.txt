Interactions with the hub to implement COHEAT functionality
===========================================================
DHD20150803

Input from the serial connection from the hub (REV2) board is line-oriented.
The initial character on a line, if punctuation, indicates the meaning of the line.
For the purposes of the 2015/08 project, these are key:

Line-start character and line meaning:

 '!' Error: text follows.
 '?' Warning: text follows.
 '>' CLI prompt; there is a limited window to respond.
 '+' An inbound frame: lines starting '+CC1 !' (alert) and '+CC1 *' (poll response) are of interest.

CLI commands should be terminated with a single new line ('\n').
The CLI can be exited with the 'E' command.
The CLI will spontaneously wake every few minutes for one prompt.
The CLI can be woken with CRLF send to the serial.
The CLI will time out and go to sleep after a couple of minutes' inactivity.

The command '+CC1 ? ...' via the CLI is used to poll a remote relay/valve node.

The +CC1 commands in and out are described more below.

Inbound CC1 messages on the serial line are:
+CC1 ! hc1 hc2
+CC1 * hc1 hc2 rh tp tr al s w sy

Parameters mean:
  * House code (hc1, hc2) of the relay/valve controller that the poll/command is being sent to.
  * relative-humidity    [0,50] 0-100 in 2% steps (rh)
  * temperature-ds18b20  [0,199] 0.000-99.999C in 1/2 C steps, pipe temp (tp)
  * temperature-opentrv  [0,199] 0.000-49.999C in 1/4 C steps, room temp (tr)
  * ambient-light        [1,62] no units, dark to light (al)
  * switch               [false,true] activation toggle, helps async poll detect intermittent use (s)
  * window               [false,true] false=closed,true=open (w)
  * syncing              [false,true] if true, (re)syncing to FHT8V (sy)

Example:

  +CC1 * 98 98 32 42 78 14 1 1 0

Poll response from relay with house code 98 98 reporting:
  * 64% relative humidity
  * 21C ext/pipe
  * 19.5C on the board
  * ambient light of '14'
  * switch '1'
  * window open
  * not syncing with FHT8V


The outbound CC1 message sent via the CLI is:
+CC1 ? hc1 hc2 rp lc lt lf

Parameters mean:
  * House code (hc1, hc2) of the relay/valve controller that the poll/command is being sent to.
  * rad-open-percent     [0,100] 0-100 in 1% steps, percent open approx to set rad valve (rp)
  * light-colour         [0,3] bit flags 1==red 2==green 0 => stop everything (lc)
  * light-on-time        [1,15] (0 not allowed) 30-450s in units of 30s (lt)
  * light-flash          [1,3] (0 not allowed) 1==single 2==double 3==on (lf)

Example:

  +CC1 ? 98 98 50 2 1 3

Poll relay with house code 98 98, commanding to move valve to 50%, LED on green on 30s.

A poll response should arrive within a few seconds (allow 10s),
if not then the message in either direction may have been lost,
and the hub should consider a resend/retry.


General notes:

 1) Transmissions are not guaranteed to arrive.
 2) Bandwidth is a very scare resource; don't send more than is necessary.
 3) Poll/command should be sent by hub at least every 15m; relay will timeout after 30m and go to 'safe' state.
 4) Poll response should be sent by relay within a few seconds (allow 10s) of poll/command.
 5) Note that ALL REV2/hub units potentially hear ALL traffic (eg alerts and poll responses).
 6) Note that REV9s will only respond to poll/cmd messages addressed to their housecode.
 7) REV2/REV9 units cannot listen while transmitting, eg when the REV9 is talking to the FHT8V which it does intensely during sync.


Suggestions to maximise radio performance:

 1) Poll each relay once every 15 minutes, repeating once or twice if no response is heard within 5--10s.
 2) Partition polling by hub and time so that no two nearby hubs are polling in the same minute (of each 15).
 3) Consider randomising polling order and/or offset to help avoid deadly embraces.
 4) An alert can always be immediately responded to with a poll, though response can be deferred if required.

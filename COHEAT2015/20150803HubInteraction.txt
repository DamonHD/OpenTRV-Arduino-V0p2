Interactions with the hub to implement COHEAT functionality
===========================================================
DHD20150803

Input from the serial connection from the hub (REV2) board is line-oriented.
The initial character on a line, if punctuation, indicates the meaning of the line.
For the purposes of the 2015/08 project, these are key:

Line-start character and line meaning:

 '!' Error: text follows.
 '?' Warning: text follows.
 '>' CLI prompt; there is a limited window to respond.
 '+' An inbound frame: lines starting '+CC1 !' (alert) and '+CC1 *' (poll response) are of interest.

CLI commands should be terminated with a single new line ('\n').
The CLI can be exited with the 'E' command.
The CLI will spontaneously wake every few minutes for one prompt.
The CLI can be woken with CRLF send to the serial.
The CLI will time out and go to sleep after a couple of minutes' inactivity.

The command '+CC1 ? ...' is used to poll a remote relay/valve node.

The +CC1 commands in and out are described more below.

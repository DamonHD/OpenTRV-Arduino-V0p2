Links as numbered on diagram and traffic on them.

 1) Link between RPi and REV2 'hub'.

    1-to-1, bidirectional, serial/USB.

    RPi sends CLI commands (including text-encoded '?') commands to the hub.
    RPi receives status and decoded messages (including text-encoded '!' and '*') from the hub.

 2) Link between REV2 'hub' and REV9 'relay'.
 
    1-to-many, bidirectional, FS20 carrier (868.35MHz, OOK, 5kbps) custom protocol (not FS20).

    The relay uses the associated FHT8V housecode, acting as its proxy.

    This house code will need to be set to match the FHT8V's, via the CLI ('H' command).

    The relay will ignore all inbound messages except those with its house code and in custom format.

    The hub may do no particular filtering and pass on all inbound '!' and '*' messages
    (and all outbound '?' messages delivered over the CLI)
    leaving the less-constrained RPi to decide which to handle and which to ignore.

    The hub sends '?' messages to the relay to poll it and set state (expecting '*' sync responses with data).
    The hub receives '!' and '*' messages from the relay, the '!' being an async alert.

 3) Link between REV9 'relay' and FHT8V valve driver.
 
    1-to-1, unidirectional (FHT8V is RX only), FS20 (868.35MHz, OOK).

    The FHT8V has a two byte housecode, each byte ranging from [0,99], factory set.

    The FHT8V will ignore all inbound messages except those with its house code and in FS20 format.

    The FHT8V sends nothing.
    The FHT8V receives FS20 (0x26 valve position) commands from the relay.

For (2) and (3), in part to be compatible with existing custom use of FS20 carrier, the following will hold:

  a) The first byte will be one of '!', '?' or '*' to indicate the message type for the initial forms.
  b) The first byte will later be one of '!', '?' or '*' ORed with '0x80' to indicate a secure message variant.
  c) The second byte will be a length byte (nn) of the rest of the frame excluding CRC.
  d) nn bytes of data will follow of which the first two bytes will be the house code.
  e) The 7-bit CRC will follow, arranged to never be 0x00 or 0xff.
  f) For the secure forms the message type and length and the house code will be part of the authenticated data.

  * Format of hub/relay messages: type len body-body-body crc7


Note 1: The hub/relay protocol may be upgraded to something better
    (eg faster, different channel, tweaked format that better suits native handling in the RFM23Bs).

Date: 2016/01/23
JIRA/ID for patch issue: COH-72 (early test release)
Reason for patch: early test release for move to latest main line with improved radio, etc
Code path: COHEAT2015/20160123-snapshot

Notes:
  * Contains snapshot of the mainline code to compile,
    and the ZIPs of the two libraries OTRadioLink and OTProtocolCC
    to install into your IDE (1.6.5 please, 1.6.6 has at least one significant bug) after removing the old ones.
    The two configs relevant in in V0p2_Generic_Config.h are:
    //#define CONFIG_Trial2013Winter_Round2_CC1HUB // REV2 cut4 as CC1 hub.
    and:
    //#define CONFIG_REV9 // REV9 as CC1 relay, cut 2 of the board.
    exactly one of which should be uncommented.

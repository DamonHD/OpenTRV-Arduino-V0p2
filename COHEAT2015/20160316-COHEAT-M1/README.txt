COHEAT standalone release with minimal boilerplate OpenTRV code and ability to support secure comms.

This provides a minimal demonstration of security with authentication and encryption,
but with some of the more complex aspects (replay prevention) turned off
to keep the code simple for this demonstration.
A PRODUCTION SYSTEM MUST HAVE THESE FEATURES IMPLEMENTED TO BE FULLY SECURE.

Work done for COHEAT summer 2015 as adaptation of the basic OpenTRV TRV control
with most control logic moved out to a set of small Linux servers.

The modified sensor OpenTRV unit that relays commands to the valve
and as described by the schematics and so on here is V0p2 REV9.

(The radio bridges to the Linux boxes are REV2.)

Testing/fixing/patching notes for two new (cut2) REV9 delivered 2015/08/06.

  * Loaded latest REV9 code via FTDI (both boards: AVR with just bootloader, and bootloader + app).
  * Set housecode and started controlling FHT8V: onboard trace antenna apparently functional in quiet radio env.
  * Creating CONFIG_REV9_cut1 which covers the special-case code for the bugs in the first cut of the board.

Testing/fixing/patching notes for two new (cut2) REV9 delivered 2015/08/06.

  * Loaded latest REV9 code via FTDI (both boards: AVR with just bootloader, and bootloader + app).
  * Set housecode and started controlling FHT8V: onboard trace antenna apparently functional in quiet radio env.
  * Created CONFIG_REV9_cut1 which covers the special-case code for the bugs in the first cut of the board.
  * TX to FHT8V from REV9 cut2 verified (sync and valve position control).
  * TX to REV2 from REV9 cut2 verified (alert and poll response messages).
  * TX to REV9 from REV2 cut2 verified (poll/command messages).
  * Verified ambient light sensor value rises with light level, though may not be a bit low on sensitivity.
  * Verified DS18B20 response to temperature, and absence shows as 0C reading.
